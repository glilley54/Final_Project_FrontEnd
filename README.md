Dough Delivered is an ongoing capstone project that I decided to pursue for my final Project during my Professional Software Development Course at CodeClan.

I wanted to develop a full stack application that would use different programming languages and frameworks together to produce a web application that can take orders.

My plan is to follow the application through to a functioning ecommmerce application that could act as a shop to take payments for an order service.


Project Title

Dough Delivered

Order service web application

Description

An online delivery shop for pizza restaurants and pizza lovers to order first class pizza dough to their door.

This will be made in Java/Spring for the back end and React for the Front End.

Why?

I want to consolidate the technology I have learned on the course by creating a reusable model for an online shop which could be implemented by any business looking to sell their products online. E-commerce is currently undergoing a huge  growth in demand and I think this is a great opportunity to reconfirm my understanding of the tech I have learned on the course to create something I can be proud of and would be useful to businesses.

MVP Acceptance Criteria

1.	A  solid, functional online shop application that can save customer details(name, address, email address phone number and  order details to a database.

2. User should be able to view/browse products by type and add them to their shopping  basket.

3. User should be able to add orders to basket and edit and add and delete items before completing order.

4. The customer should be able to place an order by completing all the details required and submitting the form.

Extensions

1. Implementing a payment system such as Stripe to handle payment details.
Further Styling to practise Front End Web Development Skills.
